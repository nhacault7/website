      <h2>Who am I</h2>
      <p>My name is Nicholas Hacault. I was born and raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba and am a proud Canadian. My family originates from Belgium and France, coming to southern Manitoba and becoming farmers. I live with my father and younger brother in the city but we often spend time, especially in the summer, out in the country. We are extremely close and stick together while looking out for one another. I am extremely grateful to have them in my life.</p>

      <h2>Why Technology is important to me</h2>
      <p>I have a passion for computers and code. From a very young age I showed an interest in computers, however my interest in coding started in high-school where i took every computer science class I could. The reason I love technology, computers and coding is that it's, in my opinion, the most powerful tool available to enhance lives and create change in the world. Whether it be software that controls bank records or a robot that can change the oil in your car, the only limit to what you can create is your imagination and determination. I also love that the field is constantly changing and you are constantly learning no matter how long you’ve been in it.</p>

      <h2>My passions and Hobbies</h2>
      <p>Computers are definitely what I am the most passionate about, but it is far from the only thing. I also have a huge interest in Physics, Chemistry, Astronomy and electronic circuits. This past summer my brother and I worked on building model rockets. As for electronic circuits, in high school I competed in Skills Manitoba twice, winning bronze and silver in their electronics category. (I’m still a bit bitter about the silver medal because I had tied for first with the gold medalists but the judges ended up voting in favour of him). Since so many of my interests include using a lot of critical thinking and problem solving I like to relax by playing the piano.</p>
