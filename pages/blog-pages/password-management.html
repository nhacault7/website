      <h2>Simple Actions to Keep Your Accounts Safe</h2>
      <h3>In this article I'll talk about how to keep your online accounts safe. As well as telling you how to manage your new online security practices</h3>
      <img src="../../images/padlock-on-green-door.jpg" alt="A gold colored padlock on a chain, locking two green doors together">
      <p>There’s no doubt that cyber attacks are becoming increasingly common. Even the U.S army, with 21,000 security analysts protecting their <strong>Cyber Command Unit</strong>, is outnumbered “100:1 by hackers” (Futurism, n.d.). That being said, you shouldn’t give up hope. The chances of someone targeting you personally are very slim, and there are many things you can do to actively protect yourself from any non-target-specific attack you may get caught in.</p>
      <p>The first thing you can do is enable <strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong> on all the online applications you use that support it. This one method alone, in most cases, is enough to stop your accounts from being broken into. It adds an extra layer of security by sending a verification code to your phone number, email address, or 3rd party authenticator app when you log into an account.</p>
      <p>The second practice you should consider to strengthen your online security is simply having a strong password. This means your password should not be easy to guess, such as “password1234”. Most password cracking software will have a list of common passwords it tries before moving onto more complex methods. Here are some general rules to consider when creating a strong password:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid using real words or a readable sentence (Ex: theUltimateP@ssword),</li>
        <li>DO NOT reuse a password that you’ve ever used before,</li>
        <li>Have at least 8 characters, 12 is better,</li>
        <li>Use a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters,</li>
        <li>Never use any personal information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>How to start managing your passwords.</h4>
      <p>The hardest part of creating strong passwords is remembering them. Having a different complex password for every site makes it nearly impossible to remember them all. Luckily password managing applications exist and there are a plethora of applications to choose from, some good, some bad. When you are searching for a password management application you should look for the following features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256)</strong></li>
        <li>Password sync across your devices</li>
        <li>Login autofill</li>
        <li>A strong password generator</li>
        <li>The ability to import and export your passwords</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Password managers are very secure because every password stored, is encrypted. The key used to decrypt them is your master password. Most password managers will never have your master password stored in their data centers, keep this in mind as since means it’s unrecoverable if you forget it.</p>
      <h4>The unfortunate price for security</h4>
      <p>Be prepared to do a little extra work when using your online accounts after you’ve made them secure. In the current day, data protection and inconvenience go hand in hand and it’s easy to see why so many people opt to reuse the same, easy to remember but, weak passwords. However, you can rest just a little easier knowing that you’ve made a hacker’s job <strong>a lot harder</strong> by practicing good online security techniques.</p>
