      <h2>What is SSL</h2>
      <h3>SSL might not mean anything to you, but it's important to know its role in keeping our information safe online as our lives become increasingly dependant on the internet</h3>

      <p>Secure Socket Layer (SSL), is a method of encrypting your data on the internet. It ensures when data is being passed between a client and server, or between two servers, it’s viewed <strong>only</strong> by said, participants. SSL was publicly released in 1995 and has undergone quite a few updates since then, even being replaced in 1999 by Transport Layer Security (TLS), a more secure encryption protocol. However, SSL is still the most commonly used term when referring to internet data encryption, so there is no need to panic if a website claims to be SSL secured, it is actually using TLS.</p>
      <h4>Why was SSL created?</h4>
      <p>In the early days of the World Wide Web, there was no real convention or rulesets on how data should be secured, if it was even secured, to begin with. In fact, the internet was viewed more as a novelty as opposed to the powerhouse of information and services it is today. As it slowly evolved and became more commonplace so did hacking. </p>
      <p>One of the most notable and, in all things considered, easiest, hacks to deploy was known as a “Man in the Middle” attack. Essentially, this hack worked by placing either a piece of hardware or software somewhere in the middle of two systems communication. The hacker could then eavesdrop on this communication and even change its contents without either of the original parties knowing, since, at this time, almost all data was sent through plain text. This may not be a huge deal if you are simply sending a funny message to a friend’s computer, but as more and more sensitive information was passed through the internet we needed a way to encrypt data so only the intended parties could view its contents, hence, SSL was born.</p>
      <h4>How can you tell if a webpage is SSL secured?</h4>
      <p>In modern times the majority of web pages are using some version of encryption to protect your data. In fact, some search engines actively incentivize the hosts to secure their web pages using TLS. Google will actually favour your website in search results if you have an active SSL certificate.</p>
      <p>The easiest way to tell if a webpage is SSL secured is by looking for the beginning of a webpage’s address. We’re all used to seeing “HTTP” at the beginning of web addresses, however, you may have noticed that recently that the majority of the addresses now read “HTTPS”. The “S” stands for “secure” to let you know the webpage has an active SSL certificate. You can also look for the padlock icon next to your browser’s address bar as it indicates a certificate as well. It is critical that you never submit critical personal information to a website without these hallmarks of encryption because anybody can view that data as it passes from your computer to the website’s host server.</p>
      <h4>Why you should care.</h4>
      <p>Chances are, in the past week you’ve logged into your bank account, bought something online, or corresponded with your employers through the internet. Almost every aspect of our lives, now more than ever, uses the internet in some form or another. You certainly wouldn’t want someone standing behind a door listening to your private conversations so why would you want somebody monitoring your digital information, and you can almost guarantee that if someone has gone through the effort to spy on you, it isn’t for reasons you would enjoy.</p>
